//! Thinking and reasoning metadata shared across the catalog, runtime, and UI.
//!
//! This module exists to keep the model schema focused while making the
//! "thinking" design explicit in one place.
//!
//! The motivation is that a user's logical thinking choice is not always
//! transported the same way to every provider or model family:
//!
//! - Some models do not expose thinking at all.
//! - Some models expose thinking as a request parameter such as `thinking`.
//! - Some models expose "thinking" by publishing separate model variants, for
//!   example "deepseek-chat" vs "deepseek-reasoner".
//!
//! Because of that, the runtime should not treat the request `thinking` field
//! as the only representation of thinking mode. Instead, the system uses a
//! two-step design:
//!
//! 1. The user or session stores a logical thinking selection such as
//!    `disabled`, `enabled`, or `medium`.
//! 2. The runtime resolves that logical selection into concrete provider
//!    request fields:
//!    - the final request model slug
//!    - the final optional `thinking` parameter
//!    - the effective reasoning effort
//!    - optional provider-specific extra request JSON
//!
//! This split is represented by two separate concepts:
//!
//! - `ThinkingCapability` describes what choices the UI should present.
//! - `ThinkingImplementation` describes how that choice should be applied to a
//!   request.
//!
//! Keeping those concerns separate lets the UI remain stable while the runtime
//! adapts request construction for very different provider behaviors. Provider
//! adapters then consume already-resolved request fields instead of embedding
//! model-variant logic themselves.
//!
//! `ResolvedThinkingRequest` is the boundary type produced by resolution. It is
//! the normalized transport-ready result of combining:
//!
//! - a logical model preset
//! - a logical thinking selection
//! - model-specific thinking implementation rules
//!
//! That makes model-variant thinking a catalog/runtime concern rather than a
//! provider-transport concern.
